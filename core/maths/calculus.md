1. Calculus: Single and Multi-variable
Limits and Continuity: Understand the behavior of functions and their limits.
Derivatives: Understand the rate of change, gradient descent, and optimization.
Integrals: Areas under curves, which are important for probability density functions.
Partial Derivatives: Important for optimization in functions of multiple variables.
Vector Calculus: Understanding vector fields, gradients, and directional derivatives.
Optimization: Finding local and global minima and maxima, critical for "training" machine learning models.
Lagrange Multipliers: For constrained optimization, often seen in support vector machines and some neural network architectures.
