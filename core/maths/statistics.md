Descriptive Statistics: Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, etc.
Inferential Statistics: Making predictions from data.
Hypothesis Testing: Deciding between alternatives based on data.
Confidence Intervals: Assessing the reliability of predictions.
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): Estimation technique used in many machine learning algorithms.
Regression Analysis: Foundational for supervised learning tasks.
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): For comparing different groups in classification tasks.
Non-parametric Statistics: Useful when data doesnâ€™t fit standard distributions.
