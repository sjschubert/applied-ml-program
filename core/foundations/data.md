### Data Handling and Preprocessing

1. **Data Collection and Sourcing**:
    - **Types of Data**: Understanding various types of data like structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.
    - **Sources**: Identifying where to collect data from, including databases, APIs, web scraping, sensors, etc.
    - **Data Formats**: Understanding common data formats like JSON, XML, CSV, and Parquet.
    - **Data Storage**: Intro to database management systems, data lakes, and data warehouses.
    - **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Issues like user consent, data anonymization, and GDPR compliance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - **Data Profiling**: Initial data inspection to summarize main characteristics using statistics and visualization.
    - **Data Distributions**: Examining the distribution of individual variables, looking for outliers, and assessing normality.
    - **Correlation Analysis**: Checking for relationships between variables that could affect the model.
    - **Visualizations**: Utilizing graphs and charts to visualize complex data relations.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
    - **Handling Missing Values**: Strategies for imputing or removing missing data.
    - **Data Transformation**: Techniques like normalization, standardization, and encoding categorical variables.
    - **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Techniques like resampling, weighted loss functions, etc.
    - **Text Preprocessing**: For NLP tasks, techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and dealing with stop words.
    - **Image Preprocessing**: For image tasks, techniques like image normalization, resizing, data augmentation.

4. **Feature Engineering** (Minimized):
    - **Automated Feature Selection**: Although less critical with deep learning, a brief overview of automatic feature selection techniques can be useful.
    - **Embeddings**: As deep learning often handles feature engineering implicitly, it's worth introducing embeddings as a way to understand how models learn representations.
