# Optimization

Combinatorial Optimization: Relevant in tasks like feature selection and network design.
Convex Optimization: Widely used in machine learning for ensuring global optima.
Stochastic Optimization: Includes methods like stochastic gradient descent, which is essential in training large-scale models.
Heuristic Methods: Techniques like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc., that are used for finding approximate solutions to optimization problems.
Integer Programming: Relevant in certain NLP and scheduling problems.
Multi-objective Optimization: When there are multiple conflicting objectives and trade-offs have to be managed.
Constraint Optimization: Important for problems where solutions must satisfy a set of constraints.
