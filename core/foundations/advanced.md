# Optimization

Combinatorial Optimization: Relevant in tasks like feature selection and network design.
Convex Optimization: Widely used in machine learning for ensuring global optima.
Stochastic Optimization: Includes methods like stochastic gradient descent, which is essential in training large-scale models.
Heuristic Methods: Techniques like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc., that are used for finding approximate solutions to optimization problems.
Integer Programming: Relevant in certain NLP and scheduling problems.
Multi-objective Optimization: When there are multiple conflicting objectives and trade-offs have to be managed.
Constraint Optimization: Important for problems where solutions must satisfy a set of constraints.


#### 6. Advanced Topics
- **Initialization Techniques**: Xavier, He-initialization, etc.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: SGD, Momentum, RMSprop, Adam, etc.
- **Batch Normalization**: Normalizing activations within a layer for better performance and stability.


11. Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning
What is Transfer Learning?: Understanding the reuse of pre-trained models on a new problem.
Types of Transfer Learning: Domain adaptation, task adaptation, etc.
Fine-tuning Techniques: How to adapt a pre-trained model to a new task with few samples.
When to Use Transfer Learning: Practical considerations and use-cases.
Limitations and Challenges: Understanding when transfer learning may not be suitable.
