### Machine Learning Foundations

#### A. Supervised Learning Tasks

1. **Regression**
   - Linear Regression
   - Polynomial Regression
   - Ridge/Lasso Regression
   - Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR)

2. **Classification**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - Support Vector Machines for Classification (SVC)
   - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

3. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
    - *Feedforward Neural Networks*
    - *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)*: Primarily used in image classification.
    - *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)*: Useful for sequential data like time series or natural language.
    - *Transformers*: Commonly used for NLP tasks like translation, summarization, and question-answering.
    - *Lifelong Learning Models (LLMs)*: Models that learn incrementally, adapting to new tasks while retaining prior knowledge.

4. **Time-Series Forecasting**
   - ARIMA
   - SARIMA
   - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

5. **Survival Analysis**
   - Kaplan-Meier Estimator

   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - t-SNE

2. **Clustering**
   - K-Means
   - Hierarchical Clustering

3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Isolation Forest
   - One-Class SVM

4. **Association Rule Learning**
   - Apriori
   - FP-Growth

5. **Deep Unsupervised Learning**
   - Autoencoders
   - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

#### C. Ensemble Learning Methods

1. **Bagging**
2. **Boosting**

#### D. Other Networks

1. **Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)**
2. **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)**
3. **Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs)**
