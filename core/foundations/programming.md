# Programming Languages and Frameworks for ML

This section convers the programming languages and frameworks most commonly used in industry to build machine learning systems.

## Topics

The topics cover the programming languages individually, followed by current frameworks commonly used to build ML systems.

### Programming Languages

The most common programming languages used in machine learning today are:

- Python: Python is perhaps the most popular language used in machine learning. It has a vast number of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to implement machine learning algorithms. Some of the most popular ones include NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Apache Spark.
- C++: a high-performance, compiled language that is widely used in machine learning for building models, optimizers, and other components.
- R: R is a popular language for statistical computing and graphics, and is often used in machine learning for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
- Matlab: a high-level language that is widely used in academia and research for machine learning, signal processing, and other numerical computations.

### Frameworks

The following are a number of libraries and frameworks that commonly support or are used to build machine learning systems.
- PyTorch: Another popular deep learning framework, PyTorch provides a dynamic computation graph and allows for more flexible model architecture than TensorFlow. It also has a Pythonic API and supports distributed training.
- Keras: a high-level neural network API written in Python that allows users to easily build and experiment with deep learning models. It runs on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano, which are lower-level machine learning libraries that provide the computational resources needed to train and evaluate neural networks.
- Scikit-learn: A comprehensive library for machine learning in Python, providing a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more. It also includes tools for model selection, data preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning library developed by Google, TensorFlow allows you to define, train, and run machine learning models using Python. It supports a wide range of algorithms, including neural networks, decision trees, and clustering.

### Lirbaries
- NumPy (Numerical Python): a library for working with arrays and mathematical operations in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of high-performance mathematical functions to manipulate them.
- OpenCV: While not exclusively a machine learning framework, OpenCV does have a robust set of tools for computer vision tasks, including image processing, feature detection, and object recognition. It also includes several machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering.
