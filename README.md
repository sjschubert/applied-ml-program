# Curriculum Outline
This document is a prelimnary definition of a curriculum to support development of a applied machine learning degree with a focus on engineering vs theory.

This document serves as a structured outline for the three-year curriculum, focusing on the core subjects. Each section below provides an overview of these subjects, outlining educational content, activities, and assessments by year.

## Year 1

Covers the foundational mathematics needed to work with and understand the process of training models.

### Semester 1

This semester introduces learning tasks, models, and aligning a model selection, in addition to the foundational areas of mathematics for ML.

#### Intro to Machine Learning
- Topics: High-level coverage of types of learning tasks (supervised, unsupervised, etc.), types of models (neural networks, decision trees, regression, etc.), and introduction to model selection.
- Prerequisites: None
#### Calculus I
  - Prerequisites: High school Algebra / Trig
#### Linear Algebra 1
  - Prerequisites: High school Algebra / Trig

### Semester 2

This semester continues the mathematical foundations for ML, and introduces students to all apsects of training models end to end.

#### Training Models End-to-End
   - Topics: Framing, Problem Structuring, Data Handling, Preprocessing, and Performance Metrics.  Models are still treated as a black box.
   - Prerequisites: Intro to Machine Learning
#### Calc II
   - Prerequisites: Calc I
#### Linear Algebra 2
   - Prerequisites: Linear Algebra 1
#### Introduction to Neural Network
   - Prerequisites: Calculus for Machine Learning, Linear Algebra 1 for ML, Intro to ML
